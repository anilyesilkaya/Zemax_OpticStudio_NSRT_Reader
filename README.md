# Zemax OpticsStudio Non-Sequential Ray Tracing Channel Impulse Response Generator

This project processes Zemax OpticsStudio RDB text output to generate channel characterization metrics such as channel impulse response, DC gain, channel RMS delay spread, and flatness factor.

The results from the paper ["Channel Modelling and Error Performance Investigation for Reading Lights Based In-flight LiFi"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.05911) were obtained using this script.
